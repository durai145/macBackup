There is a demo of the emulator running at:

http://www.ubercomp.com/jslm32/src/

It works much better on Chrome (using a nice terminal emulator that I borrowed
from the chromium source tree), but works on Safari and Firefox too.

To run jslm32 on your own machine:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Open your browser:
http://localhost:8000/src

Click the Start! button.

Enjoy.
